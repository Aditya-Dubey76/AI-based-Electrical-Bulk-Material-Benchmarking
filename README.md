## I developed an AI-based Electrical Bulk Material Benchmarking which will be forecasting the electrical bulk materials, such as total power cable, LCS, total light fixture, total cable tray, total earthing material (GI Strip) and total earthing material (Equipment earthing) based on an Advanced Predictive Model trained on past data. In the proposed project, I trained multiple forecasting models, such as CatBoost, Ridge Regression and Gradient Boosting, to predict key project parameters. Also, by using the streamlit-based application, the user has the liberty to choose a model, compare the R²-score and then have the proper forecasting.

### For the dataset - use your own dataset and make all the necessary changes by taking help of the code files.

### ▶️ **How to Run**
- ***Before going to Step-1, please make sure you have the dataset in the same folder where all the code files are present.***
- ***Step-1 - Train Your Models - Before using the app, ensure forecasting models are trained by using python train_forecast_model.py. This generates a forecast_model.pkl file used by the app.*** 
- ***Step-2 - Launch the Streamlit App using streamlit run app.py***
