### I developed an AI-based Electrical Bulk Material Benchmarking which will be forecasting the electrical bulk materials, such as total power cable, LCS, total light fixture, total cable tray, total earthing material (GI Strip) and total earthing material (Equipment earthing) based on an Advanced Predictive Model trained on past data. In the proposed project, I trained multiple forecasting models, such as CatBoost, Ridge Regression and Gradient Boosting, to predict key project parameters. Also, by using the streamlit-based application, the user has the liberty to choose a model, compare the RÂ²-score and then have the proper forecasting.

## For the dataset - use your own dataset and make all the necessary changes by taking help of the code files.
